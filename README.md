# TextMate macro for increasing your uber-ness

This macro automatically removes your "diff cruft" with;

    Convert Tabs To Spaces, And
    Remove Trailing Whitespace

when you use the Save Cmd (âŒ˜S)

Original idea: Christopher R. Murphy : http://blogobaggins.com/2009/03/31/waging-war-on-whitespace.html

## Installation

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
    git clone git://github.com/glennr/uber-glory-tmbundle.git Uber\ Glory.tmbundle
    cd Uber\ Glory.tmbundle
    git submodule update --init
    osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'

## Known Issues

- Makefiles are excluded from this since they need to be tab-delimited.

- Markdown linebreaks achieved via two trailing spaces are removed; use `<br>`
  tags instead.

## TODO

   add "All your base are belong to us" reference somewhere.
